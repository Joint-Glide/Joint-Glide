<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Ingredients Used In Joint Glide<br /></strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/embed/s/txe6awqRE_8">Joint Glide</a> formula is effective because it includes a few ingredients that have been proven to have positive health effects. It promotes better pain management, has a healthier response to inflammation, and helps users reduce the inflammation that worsens joint pain. Here are the details of the ingredients used in Joint Glide:</p>
<p><strong>Pine Bark Extract Pycnogenol:</strong> You already know about Pycnogenol, the most potent and effective form of pine bark extract there is. It has a special ability to neutralize the cartilage-destroying rust enzyme to protect your joints. But, the unique compounds in Pycnogenol also repair and rebuild collagen and cartilage for pain free joints too. This is why pycnogenol is such a key ingredient for relieving pain and restoring strong resilient joints.</p>
<p><strong>Devil&rsquo;s Claw Extract:</strong> As I was researching natural ingredients to repair cartilage, reduce pain and improve joint mobility, An herb named Devil&rsquo;s Claw kept showing up in studies. Devil's Claw Extract is from South Africa and it&rsquo;s been used since the early 20th century to lower joint pain and inflammation. Shockingly, devil&rsquo;s claw relieves pain just as well as NSAIDs,&nbsp; With no scary side effects &ndash; according to the journal, Rheumatology.</p>
<p><strong>Harpagoside:</strong> The power of devil&rsquo;s claw lies in a unique compound called Harpagoside. Harpagoside is proven to boost the function of chondrocytes to regrow cartilage and collagen in your joints. And when it comes to protecting your joints against the rust enzyme? A study on 609 people with knee arthritis from the British Society of Rheumatology showed that taking Devils Claw reduced the rust enzyme by 25%. Plus, it pulls water in your cartilage making it thicker, and creating a gel-like substance that cushions your joints. Devil&rsquo;s claw&rsquo;s ability to protect, regrow and increase cartilage thickness was shocking.</p>
<p><strong>White Willow Bark Extract:</strong> Another ingredient I came across was used by the Ancient Egyptians, Romans, and Greek physicians to reduce joint pain. It&rsquo;s called White Willow Bark Extract. The main compound responsible for this bark&rsquo;s anti-inflammatory and pain-relieving properties is named salicylic acid, And salicylic acid is so powerful that it&rsquo;s synthesized and used as the main ingredient in aspirin today. However, reducing inflammation and pain isn&rsquo;t all white willow bark can do for your joints and cartilage.</p>
<p><strong>Catechin:</strong> It also contains a powerful antioxidant named Catechin that protects collagen from the rust enzyme so effectively, That it&rsquo;s being studied as a natural remedy for arthritis. Catechin molecules also boost chondrocyte function to rebuild damaged collagen in your joints too. White willow bark is like an all natural aspirin that protects and regrows your collagen and cartilage. Not bad for a bark that&rsquo;s been around since 400 B.C.</p>
<p><strong>MSM &amp; Glucosamine:</strong> Next up we have two ingredients I know you&rsquo;ve heard of before,Maybe you&rsquo;ve even used them. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), and Glucosamine. Here&rsquo;s what you need to know about both of these powerful cartilage-rebuilding ingredients, They can&rsquo;t work properly if the rust enzyme is constantly tearing your cartilage apart each day. That&rsquo;s like trying to fill a bucket with water that has holes in the sides and bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Active Couple:</strong> This is why MSM and glucosamine don&rsquo;t work for so many people.Luckily, you have Pycnogenol, devil&rsquo;s claw, and white willow bark blocking the rust enzyme so MSM and glucosamine can work their magic. MSM provides the raw materials that are required for your body to make collagen, And it increases the number of chondrocyte cells to boost collagen production in your joints too. Glucosamine is a primary building block for the large molecules in cartilage that make it squishy, and able to absorb shock, Which keeps your joints feeling strong, flexible and mobile.</p>
<p><strong>Zinc, Copper, Magnesium, B6:</strong> The next few ingredients are ones that aren&rsquo;t found in other joint health products, Because most people don&rsquo;t understand how important collagen and chondrocytes are to your joints. Which is exactly why we added Zinc, Copper, Magnesium, and Vitamin B6. According to the Journal Of Biological Trace Elements Research, Zinc helps your body produce collagen for your joints. However, zinc alone won&rsquo;t do the job. Bone Repair Because after collagen is made, Copper-dependent enzymes are required to strengthen and stabilize the collagen fibers. Which is why we paired zinc and copper together in Joint Glide. But we&rsquo;re not done yet. We added another commonly overlooked mineral for joint health Magnesium. Researchers believe that magnesium is so effective at protecting cartilage and boosting chondrocyte cell function, That it could be used as a clinical treatment for arthritis. So Magnesium was a no-brainer to add to this formula. Next up we have Vitamin B6. This vitamin is essential to turn the raw materials in MSM into strong and flexible collagen in your joints.</p>
<p><strong>Black Pepper Extract:</strong> Lastly, we have Black Pepper Extract. Black pepper is a lot more than just a spice though, Because it has well-researched pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory properties. According to one study involving piperine, the compound that gives black pepper its sharp taste, Is nearly as effective at relieving arthritis pain as prednisolone, a common medication for arthritis.</p>
